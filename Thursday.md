##  Fueling and quenching star formation in galaxies: from the filaments to the cluster cores. Pascale Jablonka 

The cluster-centric distance -local density relation is only valid in a statistical sense. The most massive and quiescent galaxies are the closest to the filament axis. They've also been there for the longest time, since these overdensities only get more dense. 

Maybe we should change the question from "How much are galaxies transformed by their environments?" to "How much do galaxies define their environments?". We should be able to find specific features to each type of density at a given look-back time. 

Ram-pressure stripping is often seen in HI gas. It's more difficult to strip cold gas (HII, CO) since it's more tightly bound in a gravity's potential well. There's no _clear_ evidence for cold-gas stripping, but we also see low SFR in cluster galaxies. Maybe there are distinct molecular gas properties in high-density environments?

SEEDisCS- Alma CO measurements at z~0.5. We need to enter a routine regime of surveys of cold gas in galaxies, putting them in context both spatially and in look-back time.
