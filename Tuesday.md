# Low Surface Brightness Universe

## Review- Lee Kelvin, LJMU 
Zwicky discovered ‘Intergalactic matter’ in clusters, e.g Gregg and West 1998. Tarter+Silk 1974- possible explanation of dark matter?
Oemler 1973- not as massive as needed

Ferguson, Tanvir and von Hippel 1998- 1/10th of Virgo is in stars between galaxies (the ICL)! 
Longbardi + 2015- PNs in ICL are kinematically distinct from M87 PNs. 

Schombert 1986- some BCGs show light above their r^¼ profiles. 

### What is the ICL?
Fainter than 28.5 mag arcsec$^{-2}$- 1% night sky brightness! Often need HST.  Stars are bound to the cluster potential, but not individual galaxies. Either a diffuse blob or irregular web. 
10-20% of the mass of the cluster

### Formation mechanisms
* Primordial stellar material linked to the BCG
* Stripped stars from infalling galaxies/groups. Tidal stripping within groups is stronger than within clusters (tidal forces larger)
* Stripping from major mergers
* In-situ star-formation from tripped gas. Hard to study!

### Evolution of the ICL

Burke+2012- Fraction of cluster light in the ICL has grown size z~2, by factor of 2(?)

### LSB observational challenges 

Need appropriate observational techniques, source extraction and masking. Must worry about CCD artifacts and imaging ghosts. Are you over subtracting the sky?

Diffraction spikes are common, halos around bright stars, especially over-subtraction due to crowded fields and near massive galaxies.

Repairing over-subtraction is possible- a "Multi-model flux threshold" to correct for "divots" in the sky. 

### Future Prospects

LSST will be able to push down to very faint depths, but haven't been designed for observations of the LSB- so might not be optimised. 

## ICL in the Hubble Frontier Fields- Mirea Montes

Age and metallicity from SED fitting the ICL. Find a metallicity gradient in the ICL, ages between 2-6 Gyr younger than the BCGs. 

Evolution in fraction of ICL in cluster seems to because by passive evolution of ICL stellar populations. Montes+Trujillo 2018. _Are we measuring the same ICL at all redshifts? **Fraction** of ICL must have many systematics_ 

### Does the ICL trace DM?

Pillepich+2014,18 find a nice correlation between the slope of the stellar mass density profile and the halo mass. Compare size of clusters in X-rays and ICL. In Abell 370, the two match very well. The other clusters are smaller in ICL than X-rays. 

## Probing the LSB peripheries of galaxies with resolved stars. Annette Ferguson, IFA, Edinburgh

Simulations tell us that lots of interesting substructures live in _very_ low surface brightness galaxy outskirts. We're talking 29-32 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. This is 0.1-0.01% of the sky background! These substructures reflect the precise details of a galaxy's accretion history. Stochastic nature of hierarchical assembly- each galaxy is unique!

Place stars on a CMD. In old populations, the red giant branch is the dominant feature. By counting tip-of-the-red-giant-branch stars, we can be sensitive down to __extremely__ low surface brightnesses! E.g if we can count 10 TRGB stars per square degree, that's a surface brightness of 37 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. 

### Challenges:
Need to go ~2 mag below the tip of the red giant branch in order to get a handle on the tip. 

Local group work can be done with 4m telescopes. 5 MPc is the limit for VLT/HSC/etc

We also need a wide area. Small FOV studies are difficult to interpret, but contiguous mapping surveys are very time consuming! Also needed for mapping of contaminants.

Excellent seeing necessary! And some sources are unresolved background galaxies. 

Subaru HSC survey of M81. LSB tidal bridge between M82, M81 and NGC 3077. M82 and N3077 appear _much_ larger in LSB images too! Much larger stellar masses and sizes. 

LSST will allow use of this technique out to 5Mpc, fainter than currently possible.

## Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey- Alessia Longobardi

Often LSB light profiles aren't fit well by a single Sersic. Use of bright stellar tracers (GCs, PNe) help us to get kinematics/information out to very large radii. 

Need K-band imaging (and other colours) to get rid of MW contaminants, background galaxies, etc. No hard cuts in velocity needed!

Interesting- no UCDs in centre of Virgo? 

GC kinematics smoothly merge from kinematics in galaxies to kinematics of ICL at R>320 kpc. Nice! ICL velocity dispersion can be >1000 kms$^{-1}$, consistent if measured by GCs or PNe.

There are two GC populations here- galaxy GCs and ICL GCs. These are observed to be different (from colour colour diagrams?) and must have formed in different ways. 

From Illustris simulations- The GCs only trace the potential galaxies which have been subject to stripping. _Not sure I get this?_


## Activity around galaxies from ultra-deep imaging. Nushkia Chamba

$\Lambda$CDM predicts extremely faint streams, tails and shells. Can we quantify the amount of stellar mass in the outskirts of galaxies in Stripe 82 data? 

Look for streams/disturbed galaxies. Fraction of disturbed ellipticals increases with mass, fraction of disturbed spirals doesn't. 

Derive mass density maps. Use colours to get M/L and then use SB to get density. _How well do we trust these M/Ls?_ Need a detection algorithm to get outlines of galaxies/streams. "NoiseChisel" looks great!

In a small subset of the whole survey:
* Disturbed galaxies- 8$\pm$4% of mass in streams for spirals, 10$\pm$5 in 
* Undisturbed cases- less than this, 3-4% in both cases.

3 times less mass in streams for disturbed massive ellipticals compared to undisturbed massive ellipticals. 


## What do we know about ultra-diffuse galaxies? Javier Román 

Coma UDGs in SDSS were unclassified due to their low surface brightness. Actually reported first in 1984 (Sandage + Binggeli). 

Systematic detection has only been possible recently. E.g van Dokkum, Koda, Munoz, etc. Need to account for interlopers, but still far more prevalent than expected. They're found in all environments, with their properties varying with environment- round and red in clusters, blue and irregular in the field. 

Is there any difference between UDGs and spheroidal dwarfs? In a size-magnitude diagram, they fall in the same place as other dwarfs. 

### Formation
There's no clear evolutionary path to explain their formation. Future deep surveys could/will reveal many more of them. What's the luminosity function? 

Are they "failed" galaxies- i.e. intrinsically large things with not many stars? Or are they very large 'dwarf' objects, with inflated sizes?

Expansion by SN feedback is a possible cause. They're produced naturally in simulations of dwarf galaxies (Rong+2017, Chan+2017). Their survival in clusters is also interesting. Their spatial distribution more resembles dwarfs than MW galaxies.

### Stellar Populations
Spectroscopy is hard, but possible. Beasley+2016 find an M/L of 3000! One nice technique is to look for the bright stellar tracers (GCs). The number of GCs and the halo mass can also be used (Peng+Lim 2016, Beasley+Truijillo2016m van dokkum 2016). van Dokkum seems to conclude UDGs are failed objects, most other people say inflated dwarfs. Also, try weak lensing. Very cool! 

Population analysis- Kadowaki+2017,Gu+2017, Ferre-Mateu+2017 Ruiz-Lara+2018.   [Fe/H]~-1.0. Blue UDGs have also been found! 

Alabi+2018- Recent infall UDGs have higher absolute line-of-sight-velocities and bluer optical colours. 

## The Dragonfly Nearby Galaxy Survey- Alison Merritt

Low SB wings of your PSF are hard work to remove! You need to worry about scattered light from stars (and dense galaxy centres) and how you deal with your PSF. This is an issue whenever a bright source is smaller than your PSF!

### The Dragonfly telescope
The Dragonfly telescope is made of a number of of-the-shelf Cannon lenses. Cannon have worked _really_ hard to reduce scattered light for commercial photographers, and their special lens coatings dramatically suppress spurious reflections. This allows Dragonfly to beat previous state of the art low-surface brightness telescopes.

Started with a single lens. Then it steadily grew to 3, 8, 10 and finally 25 lenses. FOV of 5/5 square degrees, SDSS g+r filters, f/0.9(!). Each lens has its own lens, focusser, etc. 

### The Survey

We'll concentrate on 6 fields for now. Vast variety of galaxies! For some, the high surface brightness part dominates the halo, for others the high SB bit is a tiny part of the full image. This is quantified by seeing the excess mass in the best-fit disk+bulge model compared to the low-SB image. 

It's difficult to compare these observations to simulations in a fair way! This is the next area of research. 

## A library of synthetic stellar halos with the IllustrisTNG- Annalisa Pillepich

IllustrisTNG is the next generation of Illustris. It's a cosmological simulation including MHD, of boxes 50 Mpc, 100 Mpc and 300 Mpc. Compared to Illustris there are new numerical improvements, it now has MHD and updated galaxy feedback models (e.g winds)

Nice videos showing the differences between in-situ and ex-situ star-formation in the simulations. 

A correlation holds between the 3D power-law slope of stellar density and the mass of the DM halo. 

Two-phase formation. 90% of stellar mass within 30kpc has been accreted by smaller (MW-like) galaxies! Stellar mass accretion is the dominant method for making the ICL and building the BCG. Where does the BCG end and the ICL begin? It's arbitrary!

## Sloshing in its cD halo: MUSE kinematics of the central galaxy NGC 3311. Magda Arnaboldi

NGC 3311 is the BCG in the Hydra cluster. It has an extended and diffuse stellar halo and a rising $\sigma$ profile, from an unusually cold 175 km/s in the centre too 400 km/s in the outskirts (similar to the cluster $\sigma$).
Difference in systemic velocity between centre and outskirts.

Normally, h3 anti-correlates with the rotational velocity. That's not true here! H4 varies with radius, being 0 at the centre but positive at 2-4 kpc. ETG models almost always have h3>h4, but not the case here.

Photometric decomposition requires a component which is offset from the centre. Make a model of the kinematics using a "finite" mixture model. It assumes the LOSVD is made up of a _finite_ number of gaussians (not a GMM). 

NGC 3311 has a peculiar velocity with respect to the cluster barycentre. Not unexpected in $\Lambda$CDM. There is evidence from X-ray observations that the cluster isn't relaxed. Possible evidence for ongoing merging of two sub-clusters. Conclude that the cD envelope of NGC 3311 is dynamically associated with the cluster core. 

## The LSB universe, with predictions from future surveys- Gareth Martin

Our inability to study the majority of low-mass galaxies has lead to a biased view of the universe. ~80% of galaxies are LSB, with 30% of these being UDGs. 

Horizon AGN simulation. Find a significant number of LSB galaxies in less extreme environments. LSB populations are the tail end of the R_eff -f_gass distribution. Evidence that LSB galaxies are not special objects. 

Ram pressure stripping or large perturbations are needed to form the most extreme LSB galaxies (i.e. UDGs). The majority of LSB galaxies require stellar feedback.

# Cosmology with the SKA

## Weak gravitational lensing with the Square Kilometre Array- Mike Brown

Current state of the art for weak lensing: KIDS and DES. Cosmology is becoming a systematics-limited science! Need just as exquisite control of systematics, otherwise your exquisite precision is wasted. 

Major weak-lensing systematics:

* Instrumental systematics
* Intrinsic alignment which mimics your cosmic shear signal 
* Photo-z errors
* Colour gradients across galaxy images combined with a wavelength dependent PSF. 

Cosmology with radio-optical shear cross-correlations- Camera, Harrison, Bonaldi+Brown (2017). Gets rid of your systematics nicely (when you get a detection...).

Orientation of integrated polarised emission is unaffected by gravitational lensing. And radio polarisation traces a galaxy alignment (at least to an extent). So combining the two can be used to suppress systematics from intrinsic alignment. We can do a similar thing with HI gas kinematics, although I'm a bit more sceptical of this- misaligned gas?

## Key questions

* Intrinsic shape noise of radio galaxies?
* Fraction of galaxies that will be visible (and whose shapes can be measured) in both optical and radio surveys. 
* Radio surveys are catching up in number counts, but aren't there yet

Future e-MERLIN upgrades/observations will help to measure intrinsic shapes of radio galaxies. 

Radio weak lensing surveys will be competitive with optical ones. Much work is required with regards to shape measurements and understanding source populations, however. Cross correlations will be the key!

## Radio Luminosity Functions- Josie Peters

Radio sources are useful because you peer through the dust. Around half of starlight in the universe is scattered by dust. 

Normally use a "1/V_max method". This involves finding the maximum observable redshift of a source and then turn this into a volume. This ignores the distribution of spectral indices among a population. 

Assuming all sources have $\alpha=0.7$ will make you overestimate the luminosity of sources with $\alpha$ flatter than this. Fit with your luminosity, redshift and alpha information. Next step will use angular diameter too. 

## Exploiting cross-beam information in hierarchical phases-array imaging- Mattieu Simeoni

Hierarchical phases arrays combine many small antennae together into stations. You essentially create "virtual" dishes at each beam-forming station, linearly combining the antennae to compress the data and achieve higher spatial filtering. Furthermore, survey time is reduced compared to observing with usual dish arrays.

The reduction pipeline is complicated! Mosaicing, unstable non-diagonal correlation matrices, etc... The Bluebild algorithm seems to deal with this okay! 

## Magnetic Fields Forever- Franco Vazza  

Where do observed magnetic fields come from? Many scenarios can produce micro-Gauss fields in galaxy clusters. They provide very different predictions for cluster outskirts and filaments though! SKA-low should be able to tell the difference between the source of synchrotron emission from the shocked cosmic web- astrophysical or primordial?

Interesting possibilities for cross-correlation between SKA and ATHENA (next-gen X-Ray satellite, in ~2028). 

CosmoDEEP- a convolutional neural net for detection of extended radio sources. One 2000x2000 pixel image processed in 0.1 seconds, with 90% recovery of injected sources.
