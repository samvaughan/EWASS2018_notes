# Low Surface Brightness Universe

### Review: 
Zwicky discovered ‘Intergalactic matter’ in clusters, e.g Gregg and West 1998. Tarter+Silk 1974- possible explanation of dark matter?
Oemler 1973- not as massive as needed

Ferguson, Tanvir and von Hippel 1998- 1/10th of Virgo is in stars between galaxies (the ICL)! 
Longbardi + 2015- PNs in ICL are kinematically distinct from M87 PNs. 

Schombert 1986- some BCGs show light above their r^¼ profiles. 

### What is the ICL?
Fainter than 28.5 mag arcsec^-2- 1% night sky brightness! Need HST.  Stars are bound to the cluster potential, but not individual galaxies. Either a diffuse blob or irregular web. 
10-20% of the mass of the cluster

### Formation mechanisms
* Primordial stellar material linked to the BCG
* Stripped stars from infalling galaxies/groups. Tidal stripping within groups is stronger than within clusters (tidal forces larger)
* Stripping from major mergers
* In-situ star-formation from tripped gas. Hard to study!

### Evolution of the ICL

Burke+2012- Fraction of cluster light in the ICL has grown size z~2, bu factor of 2(?)

# LSB observational challenges 

Need appropriate observational techniques, source extraction and masking. Must worry about CCD artefacts and imaging ghosts. Are you over subtracting the sky?
