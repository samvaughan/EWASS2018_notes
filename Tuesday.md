# Low Surface Brightness Universe

## Review- Kelvin, LJMU 
Zwicky discovered ‘Intergalactic matter’ in clusters, e.g Gregg and West 1998. Tarter+Silk 1974- possible explanation of dark matter?
Oemler 1973- not as massive as needed

Ferguson, Tanvir and von Hippel 1998- 1/10th of Virgo is in stars between galaxies (the ICL)! 
Longbardi + 2015- PNs in ICL are kinematically distinct from M87 PNs. 

Schombert 1986- some BCGs show light above their r^¼ profiles. 

### What is the ICL?
Fainter than 28.5 mag arcsec^-2- 1% night sky brightness! Often need HST.  Stars are bound to the cluster potential, but not individual galaxies. Either a diffuse blob or irregular web. 
10-20% of the mass of the cluster

### Formation mechanisms
* Primordial stellar material linked to the BCG
* Stripped stars from infalling galaxies/groups. Tidal stripping within groups is stronger than within clusters (tidal forces larger)
* Stripping from major mergers
* In-situ star-formation from tripped gas. Hard to study!

### Evolution of the ICL

Burke+2012- Fraction of cluster light in the ICL has grown size z~2, bu factor of 2(?)

### LSB observational challenges 

Need appropriate observational techniques, source extraction and masking. Must worry about CCD artifacts and imaging ghosts. Are you over subtracting the sky?

Diffraction spikes are common, halos around bright stars, especially over-subtraction due to crowded fields and near massive galaxies.

Repairing over-subtraction is possible- a "Multi-model flux threshold" to correct for "divots" in the sky. 

### Future Prospects

LSST will be able to push down to very faint depths, but haven't been designed for observations of the LSB- so might not be optimised. 

# ICL in the Hubble Frontier Fields- Mirea Montes

Age and metallicity from SED fitting the ICL. Find a metallicity gradient in the ICL, ages between 2-6 Gyr younger than the BCGs. 

Evolution in fraction of ICL in cluster seems to because by passive evolution of ICL stellar populations. Montes+Trujillo 2018. _Are we measuring the same ICL at all redshifts? **Fraction** of ICL must have many systematics_ 

### Does the ICL trace DM?

Pillepich+2014,18 find a nice correlation between the slope of the stellar mass density profile and the halo mass. Compare size of clusters in X-rays and ICL. In Abell 370, the two match very well. The other clusters are smaller in ICL than X-rays.
