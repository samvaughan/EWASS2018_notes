# Low Surface Brightness Universe

## Review- Kelvin, LJMU 
Zwicky discovered ‘Intergalactic matter’ in clusters, e.g Gregg and West 1998. Tarter+Silk 1974- possible explanation of dark matter?
Oemler 1973- not as massive as needed

Ferguson, Tanvir and von Hippel 1998- 1/10th of Virgo is in stars between galaxies (the ICL)! 
Longbardi + 2015- PNs in ICL are kinematically distinct from M87 PNs. 

Schombert 1986- some BCGs show light above their r^¼ profiles. 

### What is the ICL?
Fainter than 28.5 mag arcsec$^{-2}$- 1% night sky brightness! Often need HST.  Stars are bound to the cluster potential, but not individual galaxies. Either a diffuse blob or irregular web. 
10-20% of the mass of the cluster

### Formation mechanisms
* Primordial stellar material linked to the BCG
* Stripped stars from infalling galaxies/groups. Tidal stripping within groups is stronger than within clusters (tidal forces larger)
* Stripping from major mergers
* In-situ star-formation from tripped gas. Hard to study!

### Evolution of the ICL

Burke+2012- Fraction of cluster light in the ICL has grown size z~2, by factor of 2(?)

### LSB observational challenges 

Need appropriate observational techniques, source extraction and masking. Must worry about CCD artifacts and imaging ghosts. Are you over subtracting the sky?

Diffraction spikes are common, halos around bright stars, especially over-subtraction due to crowded fields and near massive galaxies.

Repairing over-subtraction is possible- a "Multi-model flux threshold" to correct for "divots" in the sky. 

### Future Prospects

LSST will be able to push down to very faint depths, but haven't been designed for observations of the LSB- so might not be optimised. 

# ICL in the Hubble Frontier Fields- Mirea Montes

Age and metallicity from SED fitting the ICL. Find a metallicity gradient in the ICL, ages between 2-6 Gyr younger than the BCGs. 

Evolution in fraction of ICL in cluster seems to because by passive evolution of ICL stellar populations. Montes+Trujillo 2018. _Are we measuring the same ICL at all redshifts? **Fraction** of ICL must have many systematics_ 

### Does the ICL trace DM?

Pillepich+2014,18 find a nice correlation between the slope of the stellar mass density profile and the halo mass. Compare size of clusters in X-rays and ICL. In Abell 370, the two match very well. The other clusters are smaller in ICL than X-rays. 

# Probing the LSB peripheries of galaxies with resolved stars. Annette Ferguson, IFA, Edinburgh

Simulations tell us that lots of interesting substructures live in _very_ low surface brightness galaxy outskirts. We're talking 29-32 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. This is 0.1-0.01% of the sky background! These substructures reflect the precise details of a galaxy's accretion history. Stochastic nature of hierarchical assembly- each galaxy is unique!

Place stars on a CMD. In old populations, the red giant branch is the dominant feature. By counting tip-of-the-red-giant-branch stars, we can be sensitive down to __extremely__ low surface brightnesses! E.g if we can count 10 TRGB stars per square degree, that's a surface brightness of 37 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. 

### Challenges:
Need to go ~2 mag below the tip of the red giant branch in order to get a handle on the tip. 

Local group work can be done with 4m telescopes. 5 MPc is the limit for VLT/HSC/etc

We also need a wide area. Small FOV studies are difficult to interpret, but contiguous mapping surveys are very time consuming! Also needed for mapping of contaminants.

Excellent seeing necessary! And some sources are unresolved background galaxies. 

Subaru HSC survey of M81. LSB tidal bridge between M82, M81 and NGC 3077. M82 and N3077 appear _much_ larger in LSB images too! Much larger stellar masses and sizes. 

LSST will allow use of this technique out to 5Mpc, fainter than currently possible.

# Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey- Alessia Longobardi

Often LSB light profiles aren't fit well by a single Sersic. Use of bright stellar tracers (GCs, PNe) help us to get kinematics/information out to very large radii. 

Need K-band imaging (and other colours) to get rid of MW contaminants, background galaxies, etc. No hard cuts in velocity needed!

Interesting- no UCDs in centre of Virgo? 

GC kinematics smoothly merge from kinematics in galaxies to kinematics of ICL at R>320 kpc. Nice! ICL velocity dispersion can be >1000 kms$^{-1}$, consistent if measured by GCs or PNe.

There are two GC populations here- galaxy GCs and ICL GCs. These are observed to be different (from colour colour diagrams?) and must have formed in different ways. 

From Illustris simulations- The GCs only trace the potential galaxies which have been subject to stripping. _Not sure I get this?_
